#puppet-mgmtgraph

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ffrank/puppet-mgmtgraph.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ffrank/puppet-mgmtgraph)

Adds the `:mgmtgraph` face and `puppet mgmtgraph` subcommand to [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet).
It allows you to compile simple Puppet manifest into a data structure that is
suitable for [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) to consume.
